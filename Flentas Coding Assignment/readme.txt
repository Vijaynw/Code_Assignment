Solution

Step 1: Created a log file.
Step 2: Read the log file by using Python using files.readlines().
Step 3: Created a list of data in which we have appended the data read from the files.
Step 4: Created a function get_sec. Given time in HH:MM:SS converting to sec.

1. Find the distinct From Numbers for a day.
	Step 1: Created a set named output and appended the From Numbers to get the distinct numbers.
	Step 2: Used for loop to get the numbers from file and then appended the numbers in output set.

2. Find the distinct From Numbers who used the Free Plan. (Call Duration less than 1 min)
	Step 1: Again created a set named output.
	Step 2: Using for loop to get the numbers from file and then using a condition to check if the call duration is less 		than 1 min. If yes the appending the number to the set.
	
3. Find the total call duration with respect to From Number
	Step 1:Created a dictionary to save the key value pair.
	Step 2: Stored the Phone numbers along with call duration in key value pair.

4. Find the total income for a day
	Step 1: Calculated the total income by adding all the call duration price.
